# Caesar Cipher
Takes a string as input, removes all non-letter characters, applies a
caesar shift cipher of 3, and formats the output into blocks of 5 
uppercase characters padded with Xs.

For example, given the input string:

`Hello, this is a test!` 

the output will be:

`KHOOR WKLVL VDWHV WXXXX`

## Building and running

Type `gradlew run` to run the application.

Type `gradlew test` to run the unit tests.

To import into Eclipse, type `gradlew eclipse`, and then import as
an existing project.
